## OVERVIEW
### Project Background
I was a freelancing UX/UI designer hired by the Taiwan company, <a href="https://styleup.fashion/">StyleUp</a>. The company owns a website that provides lifestyle tips about makeups, beauty products, hair styles, etc. It wanted to further develop new business model, convert its site traffic and make profits through building a platform that connects between its website users and local salons. The platform was both on web and on mobile phone app. I was tasked to create eventually high-fidelity website mockups for further development.

## TAKEAWAYS
This was my first project communicating with clients to make sure their business needs were met. Cooperating remotely made the communication more difficult. Sometimes misunderstandings of the clients' feedbacks occured. Especially at the earlier stages considering structure of the whole site, one misunderstanding could cost a lot of efforts. And sometimes the client returned feedback and was expecting a faster iteration return, while I wasn't available to immediately do that. However the communication became smoother after we formalized the schedule and developed more common ground of the website. It was a valuable experience for me to elicit my voice making sure both clients' needs and my work-life balance were met. 

It also made me think about that though the project was proposed by the client, it didn't mean client necessarily take the authoritative voice. Hired as a UX designer, I should argue my opinions of what might provide a better user experience -- for the benefit of the client as well. 

Sadly after completing the deliverables, I wasn't able to hear following up feedbacks from the clients about development progress.

## Portfolio Website
Personal Portfolio to showcase design projects' processes.
Currently constantly upgrading and improving.

## Implementation goal
**in bold**: next thing to work on

### Homepage
#### Top navbar
- [x]hamburger menu under mobile
- [ ] under mobile, top navbar toggled should be less opaque

#### Landing screen
- [ ]background: particle effect? photo?
- [ ]Styling words

#### "work"
- [ ] on hover, work grid has color overlay and white text
  - currently grid is mostly default BS card

#### "about" (currently combined into landing screen)
- [ ] "about" section words
- [x] update Resume

#### "contact"
- [x] contact section words
- [x] contact section
- [ ] fill-in form to contact? more interactive? more design?

### Work Exhibition
- [ ] each page link to "next" and "previous" project
  - Another way: have a toggle menu at the top or bottom showing other projects' title images  
- [x] some images worth showing should be a modal and can be clicked open to view larger version
- [ ] carousel caption display is questionable

#### StyleUp
- [x] design page
- [x] write design process
- [ ] create journey map to better present
- [ ] create different stakeholders' map

#### spacemealbox
- now temporarily linked to pinshape page.
- [ ] **write content and put in the page**

#### dianrong
- [x] write content and put in the page

### footer
- [ ] Would words instead of icons be more clear to users?

## Framework / Tools used
- SCSS
- Bootstrap 4.0

## Further questions
- [ ] smooth scroll to next section
- [ ] Fade-in & Fade-out between pages
- [ ] "jump to top" button on longer pages, especially work exhibitions
- [ ] can I populate HTMLs based on one template for "works"?
- [ ] insert GA tracking code: track main devices, location
- [ ] index page under tablet display is problematic
- [ ] code optimization: dynamically change modal, carousels should be auto-generated with available images in the directory (styleup page)

Personal Portfolio to showcase design projects' processes.
Currently constantly upgrading and improving.


## Design Goal:

  - show design works using user-centered process
- User-friendliness concerns
  - Clean, straightforward
- Add personal style
  - High contrast
  - Borders
  - Types
  - ...

## Tracking Goal:
and how these tracking measures can affect design decisions
- visitors' locations
- which page would stay the longest
- which button clicked most
- which project clicked most
- For those who read carefully (stayed on pages for more than 5 seconds),
 how often would visitors open the modal through clicking on photos? (would they get the magnifying hint)
